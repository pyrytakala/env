- Dont update README unless I specifically ask you to.
- If you get errors related to being in the wrong folder, run commands like 'pwd', 'ls | head -50', 'cd' or 'tree | head -50' to figure out where you are.
- Do not spend time fixing non-critical linter errors
- Avoid using magic numbers, use variable names instead. E.g. rather BATCH_SIZE than '36' 
- I am developing on a modern Mac laptop
